The app basically deals with two problems. The first one is, people often forget their belongings at some place and sometimes they even forget from where they have to pick up that thing. The second problem that our app deals with is a bit major one. All of us have lost our items somewhere and sometimes lost a rather important one. If someone else finds that item then also many times there is no way to return it to the owner.
The app is dividesld into two sections:
1. This section allows you to write a note about where you leaving the item, description about the item etc. You can add images of the item and also add reminder of when to pick it up.
2. In this section one person who found something can register that item in the found section of the app and other person can search it from the list of lost items in the lost section. The person on finding his thing has to verify that the item belong to him after which he can contact that person to get back the item.
